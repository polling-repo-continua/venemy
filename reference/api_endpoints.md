## Venmo API v1




##Venmo API v5

Some super smart college kids from MIT actually identified a number of vulnerabilities with Venmo and mapped out the v5 API. You can read their paper [here](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2014/files/13-benkraft-jmoldow-mannes-venmo.pdf). Leveraging their work, I was able to build venemy rather quickly.
